# NourishPet: Feed Yourself, Feed Your Friend

NourishPet is a mobile web app that makes nutrition tracking fun by turning it into a game of raising a virtual pet. When users eat healthy, their pet gets fed and grows.

## What and Why?

We will build **NourishPet**, a gamified application for tracking daily nutritional intake.

The system solves the problem of low user engagement in traditional health apps. Standard nutrition trackers are boring. They're full of charts and numbers, and tracking what one eats feels like a homework assignment. This lack of positive reinforcement leads to users quickly abandoning their long-term health goals. This is an important problem because establishing sustainable, healthy eating habits is a big challenge, and existing tools often fail because they are not enjoyable to use.

That's the problem we want to fix. We think that by tying nutritional goals to the growth and happiness of a virtual pet, we can create a positive and lasting motivation to eat healthier. Instead of focusing on just data, we're focusing on creating an emotional connection that makes users want to come back every day.

## For Whom?

We are building this for **university students like ourselves**. We're busy, we're often making our own food choices for the first time, and we could use a fun, simple way to make sure we're eating well.

Our first users will be our friends and classmates right here on campus. This is great because it means we can get real, honest feedback from the very people we want the app to help, right from the start. With that, we can ensure our **product** is genuinely useful and well-suited to its intended users.

## How?

- Sign up and adopt a virtual pet to begin the journey.  
- Set daily nutrition goals: choose from standard guidelines (based on weight and health data) or custom targets (e.g., focus on protein, iron).  
- View the pet’s home screen, which also displays progress bars for daily nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals.  
- Log meals by searching for foods and entering quantities; the app calculates nutrients and updates progress automatically.  
- Meeting daily goals unlocks rewards such as “Vita-Bones” or bowls of healthy pet food.  
- Feed rewards to the pet, making it happy and allowing it to gain XP and level up.  
- Over time, see the pet grow from a small puppy into a healthy adult dog, reinforcing healthy eating with visible progress.   

## Scope

We're confident this project is a perfect fit for a five-member team for one semester—it's challenging but definitely achievable.

What makes it a **real challenge** is that it's more than just a simple data-entry app. We'll need to connect to a **third-party nutrition API** (e.g., USDA FoodData Central) to get all our food data, which is a significant integration task. We also have to design a fun and engaging reward system on the front-end.

At the same time, **it's not overly ambitious**. We can keep the initial scope focused. The goal for the semester is to get the core loop working perfectly: one user, one pet, and the basic feed-and-grow mechanic. Features like adding friends, different types of pets, and AI-powered meal suggestions are great ideas for the future, but we can deliver a complete, polished product by focusing on the main experience first. With a team of 4-6, the work can be split effectively between the backend (handling the data and APIs) and frontend (making the pet and dashboard look great).
