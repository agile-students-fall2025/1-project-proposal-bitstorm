# NourishPet: Feed Yourself, Feed Your Friend

NourishPet is a mobile web application that transforms the tedious task of daily nutrition tracking into the rewarding and engaging experience of raising a virtual pet. The idea is simple: users take care of a virtual pet by taking care of themselves. When users eat healthy, their pet gets to eat and grow.

## What and Why?

We will build **NourishPet**, a gamified application for tracking daily nutritional intake.

The system solves the problem of low user engagement in traditional health apps. Standard nutrition trackers are boring. They're full of charts and numbers, and tracking what one eats feels like a homework assignment. This lack of positive reinforcement leads to users quickly abandoning their long-term health goals. This is an important problem because establishing sustainable, healthy eating habits is a big challenge, and existing tools often fail because they are not enjoyable to use.

That's the problem we want to fix. We think that by tying nutritional goals to the growth and happiness of a virtual pet, we can create a positive and lasting motivation to eat healthier. Instead of focusing on just data, we're focusing on creating an emotional connection that makes users want to come back every day.

## For Whom?

We are building this for **university students like ourselves**. We're busy, we're often making our own food choices for the first time, and we could use a fun, simple way to make sure we're eating well.

Our first users will be our friends and classmates right here on campus. This is great because it means we can get real, honest feedback from the very people we want the app to help, right from the start. With that, we can ensure our **product** is genuinely useful and well-suited to its intended users.

## How?

From the user's perspective, the system functions as a daily pet-care and self-care routine.

First, a user signs up and gets to **adopt their own virtual pet**, like a little puppy. Next, the user sets up their daily health goals. They have two choices: they can either follow a set of **standard nutritional requirements** based on general health guidelines (automatically generated according to their current and target weight), or they can **customize their own goals** if they have specific targets in mind (like focusing on protein or iron).

The main screen is the pet's home, where the user also sees their daily nutrition goals—like progress bars for protein, vitamins, and so on. Throughout the day, the user logs meals by searching for ingredients (e.g., "banana," "spinach," "chicken") and entering the quantity eaten. The app then calculates the nutrients from the meal and updates the user's progress bars.

If the user successfully meets their key nutritional goals for the day, they earn a special reward: a **"Vita-Bone"** or a bowl of healthy pet food. The user can feed this item to their pet, and the pet will become happy and gain experience points.

Day after day, as the user keeps eating well, they will see their pet **grow from a puppy into an adult dog**. This simple feedback loop—eat well, and watch a companion thrive—creates a long-term emotional connection and encourages daily engagement.

## Scope

We're confident this project is a perfect fit for a five-member team for one semester—it's challenging but definitely achievable.

What makes it a **real challenge** is that it's more than just a simple data-entry app. We'll need to connect to a **third-party nutrition API** (e.g., USDA FoodData Central) to get all our food data, which is a significant integration task. We also have to design a fun and engaging reward system on the front-end.

At the same time, **it's not overly ambitious**. We can keep the initial scope focused. The goal for the semester is to get the core loop working perfectly: one user, one pet, and the basic feed-and-grow mechanic. Features like adding friends, different types of pets, and AI-powered meal suggestions are great ideas for the future, but we can deliver a complete, polished product by focusing on the main experience first. With a team of 4-6, the work can be split effectively between the backend (handling the data and APIs) and frontend (making the pet and dashboard look great).
