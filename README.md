## NourishPet: Feed Yourself, Feed Your Friend

NourishPet is a mobile web app that makes nutrition tracking fun by turning it into a game of raising a virtual pet. When users eat healthy, their pet gets fed and grows.

## What and Why?

We will build **NourishPet**, a gamified application for tracking daily nutritional intake.

Traditional health apps struggle with engagement and long-term commitment. Standard nutrition tracker feels like a homework assignment, full with charts and numbers. This lack of positive reinforcement results in low user retention. 

Our goal is to strike the balance between promoting sustainable, healthy eating habits and making the experience engaging and enjoyable.

We propose to solve this by linking nutritional progress to the growth of a virtual pet, turning healthy habits into an enjoyable, emotionally rewarding experience that keeps users coming back. Instead of focusing on just data, we're focusing on creating an emotional connection that makes users want to come back every day.

## For Whom?

- People with busy schedules balancing school, work, and body health.  
- People in cities like New York, where restaurants are expensive and many people start cooking their own meals.  
- People make own food choice for the first time and needing simple guidance.  
- Health-conscious users who want to eat better and maintain a good body shape, but find existing apps boring.  
- Our first testers will be friends and classmates on campus, giving us real and honest feedback. 

## How?

- Sign up and adopt a virtual pet to begin the journey.  
- Set daily nutrition goals: choose from standard guidelines (based on weight and health data) or custom targets (e.g., focus on protein, iron).  
- View the pet’s home screen, which also displays progress bars for daily nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals.  
- Log meals by searching for foods and entering quantities; the app calculates nutrients and updates progress automatically.  
- Meeting daily goals unlocks rewards such as “Vita-Bones” or bowls of healthy pet food.  
- Feed rewards to the pet, making it happy and allowing it to gain XP and level up.  
- Over time, see the pet grow from a small puppy into a healthy adult dog, reinforcing healthy eating with visible progress.   

## Scope

We're confident this project is a perfect fit for a five-member team for one semester — it's challenging but definitely achievable.

What makes it a **real challenge** is that it's more than just a simple data-entry app. We'll need to connect to a **third-party nutrition API** (e.g., USDA FoodData Central) to get all our food data, which is a significant integration task. We also have to design a fun and engaging reward system on the front-end.

At the same time, **it's not overly ambitious**. We can keep the initial scope focused. The goal for the semester is to get the core loop working perfectly: one user, one pet, and the basic feed-and-grow mechanic. Features like adding friends, different types of pets, and AI-powered meal suggestions are great ideas for the future, but we can deliver a complete, polished product by focusing on the main experience first. With a team of 4-6, the work can be split effectively between the backend (handling the data and APIs) and frontend (making the pet and dashboard look great).
